        We are Glasses. We love this planet. We also love looking good and we
        don’t see why anyone should ever have to choose between the two.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is why we only use biodegradable and recycled materials to make
        high quality and stylish eyewear. For you and for your planet.
      </p>

      <p>So don’t just look good. Look good for your planet!</p>
